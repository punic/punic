Language Data
=============


To keep the size of the package at a reasonable level, only data for a limited set of languages (about 40, defined here) is included by default.
If you need more, you can get them yourself using the bundled punic-data script.

To get help about how to run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bin/punic-data --help

(On Windows, use ``\`` instead of ``/``)

Please remark that when you upgrade your locally installed Punic with Composer, the language files are reverted to the default ones.
In the case you want to be sure that you have the languages you need even after Punic is upgraded (for instance, af and zu_ZA),
you can add this section to your composer.json file:


.. code-block:: json-chunk

    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "punic-data --locale=+af,+zu_ZA"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "punic-data --locale=+af,+zu_ZA"
        ]
    }
            
Language data is fetched from a remote repository.
If you plan to install many languages on a regular basis, you can also evaluate to use a local language repository,
fetching this repository and instructing ``punic-data`` to use it with the ``--source-location`` option.

The default data used by Punic is the one generated by `punic/data <https://github.com/punic/data>`_.
You can clone it and use it as the data source.
